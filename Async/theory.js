/* 

Javascript => 1. Synchronous
              2. Single threaded
              
Execution Context => execute one line of code at a time
                     Each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing

blocking Code => block the flow of program => Read File Sync
Non blocking Code => does not block execution => Read File Async




Event Loop:

The event loop is a core concept in JavaScript that enables non-blocking, asynchronous behavior.
The JavaScript event loop is a fundamental mechanism that enables JavaScript to handle asynchronous 
operations and maintain a non-blocking execution model, despite being single-threaded.
It ensures that tasks like user interactions, network requests, and timers are processed efficiently 
without freezing the main thread.
